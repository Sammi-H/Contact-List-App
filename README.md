Contact List App

Description

This is a simple contact list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to help you add, view, and manage contacts. The app fetches gender information based on the name entered and displays an appropriate avatar. If the name is recognized as male, a male avatar is shown; if female, a female avatar is displayed. If the gender is unknown, a default avatar is used.

Features

Add Contacts: Users can enter a name and add it to the contact list.
Gender-Based Avatars: The app fetches gender data using the genderize.io API. It shows a male or female avatar depending on the name, or a default avatar if the name is unrecognized.
Phone and Email Info: Each contact includes a random phone number and a formatted email address based on the name.
Delete Contact: Each contact can be deleted by clicking the "X" button next to it.
Technologies Used

HTML: Structure of the web page.

I am new to working HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm still learning the basics of web development and building this app as a practice project to improve my skills. Feel free to check it out and provide any feedback!
